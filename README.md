# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is https://sleepyllama001.github.io/development-project

### Goal and Value of the Application

The goal was to practice using react, and gain an understanding of hooks and altering the state of a website based on various user constraints. The value to a user
is to account for their various manga interests and filter series to identify the perfect one for them.

### Organization of Components
The components here are the manga boxes that display the various bits of information.

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
The manga boxes have data passed through to them coming from a basic json I made to emulate the bakery example from the lab. 

### How the User Triggers State Changes
All of the user state changes are done through buttons hidden in a little filter drop down. Within there they can sort and filter to their hearts content.
